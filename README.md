# cis_benchmark

org: originally forked from https://github.com/perfecto25/perfecto25-cis_rhel7

#### Table of Contents


## Description

This is a Puppet implementation of CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks.

Unlike the original, this module does not apply all CIS benchmark rules because some parts are done in pre-provisioning state. 
Also, checks are not done for those rules because Nessus or other CIS benchmark checking tooling is supposed to handle that.

Currently only rhel7 and centos7 are implemented
